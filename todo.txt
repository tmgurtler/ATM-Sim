Welcome screen
Practice PIN entry screen
Real typing/break screens

database needs:
    user ID, PIN, which key, which attempt, timing, (which set?), (which number in set?) (on bad input, give illegal response?)
    user ID, number times gone, which group

on typing screens:
    numPINEntry == -1: display PIN
    numPINEntry == 0 or 1: display entry form, load keystroke data, check entry for correctness
        on incorrect entry, reset numPINEntry to -1
        on correct entry, increment numPINEntry
    numPINEntry == 2: display entry form, load keystroke data, check entry for correctness
        on incorrect entry, reset numPINEntry to -1
        on correct entry: move first element of order string to end of hold string
            set numPINEntry to -1
            if the hold string is 5 characters long, increment numSetEntry and go to break screen
            otherwise just reload

on break screens:
    code for loading bar? ugh.
    if numSetEntry is 3, throw away hold string before returning to typing screen
    otherwise, return hold string to beginning of order string

use a cookie?
